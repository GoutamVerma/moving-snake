# Moving Snake

This is a classic arcade game where you control a snake and navigate through a series of obstacles to eat food and grow in size. The goal is to see how far you can make it without running into the walls or your own tail, as this will result in game over.

## How To Run ?

First, install the Rust development evnironment from [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (if you do not have one).

Second, run the following command in the project directory:

```
> cargo run
```


## Controls

- Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the green snake.
- Eat the orange food to make the snake stronger (or longer).
- When the snake hits the border or itself, it dies.
